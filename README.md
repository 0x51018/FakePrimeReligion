# Fake Prime Religion

This repository contains a playful, fictional website devoted to the imaginary **Prime Faith Fellowship**.
The site embraces the quirky style of early 2000s webpages and is not meant to be taken seriously.

Open `index.html` in your browser to see the faux-religious nostalgia.
You can even try a simple **Prime Test** on the page to check whether a
number is prime.
